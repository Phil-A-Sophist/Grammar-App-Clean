# Project Context: Grammar-App-Clean

## Purpose
Refactored version of Grammar-App — a browser-based visual sentence diagramming tool. Users drag-and-drop clause, phrase, and word tiles onto a canvas to build syntax trees. Includes comprehensive user documentation.

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Static web app (no build tools, no dependencies)

## Key Files
- `index.html` — Main page and UI structure
- `script.js` — Application logic
- `style.css` — Styling and layout
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — 200+ line user manual (tile types, connections, keyboard shortcuts, export)

## Commands
Open `index.html` in a browser to run. No build step needed.

## Status
This is the active/preferred version of the Grammar-App.

## Gotchas
- No build system — edit files directly
- Has leftover tmpclaude-*-cwd temp directories that can be cleaned up
